## Disclaimer on the packages

Files jdot.py, classif.py, procedure.py and algo.py are not from this paper. 

jdot.py and classif .py can be found in the github page https://github.com/rflamary/JDOT/tree/master and is the implementation of the methods proposed by N. Courty, R. Flamary, A. Habrard, A. Rakotomamonjy, in "Joint Distribution Optimal Transportation for Domain Adaptation" published in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2017.

procedure.py and algo.py can be found in the github page https://github.com/arianemarandon/adadetect#machine-learning-meets-fdr for the implementation and is the implementation of the methods proposed by Ariane Marandon, Lihua Lei, David Mary and Etienne Roquain in the paper "Adaptive novelty detection with false discovery rate guarantee", to appear in Annals of Statistics.
